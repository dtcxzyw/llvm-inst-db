# llvm-inst-db
This is an instruction database extracted from LLVM source. It allows you to reuse existing instruction information defined by LLVM td files.

I don't know what is the usefulness of this database. It might help you rapid prototype a compiler/assembler/disassembler/... (without the dependency of LLVM).

View the instruction documentation here: https://dtcxzyw.github.io/llvm-inst-db.
The database (in json format) is available at the artifact of the latest GH action: https://github.com/dtcxzyw/llvm-inst-db/actions/workflows/deploy.yml.
